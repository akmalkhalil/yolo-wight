==========

just any little random projects i've been working on


<p>any little projects that i've worked on for a short amount of time or to test out an idea
<br/>
so far it's just the little car game and me trying some algorithmic drawing
<br/>
the reason it's algorithmic drawing 2 is because my first attempt was pretty rubbish

the data from the csv came from <a href = "http://cloford.com/resources/colours/500col.htm"> here </a>
